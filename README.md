# GGJ-DoubleComfort
Finding House

This is a project a group of indie devs and students worked on during the seattle indies global game jam.
The theme for this year was whatever home meant to us, and we as a group decided that home is somthing very comforting no matter the situation, and our game needed to reflect that.
Finding house is 3d surrel fantasy game where the player is a little girl in the middle of a nightmare taking place in her house. The player spents most of the game walking around the house trying to avoid nightmare demons, andthe only way to wake up from this dream is for the player to collectitems that makes the little girl feel more at home.
